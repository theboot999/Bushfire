//So we have a driveway tile
//And we also have a parking tile
//Car park tiles will be central
//driveway tiles offset so can have 2 cars next to each other?





//FIX transparency on game view box for the game image


//Thoughts for driveways and parking lots
//In our editor, we need to a building type.  House, Localbuilding(For everyyone)

//So we have 2 lists.  a list of destinations.  
// 1 list = destinations for everyone.  
// 1 list = destinations for specific vehicle type.  
// 1 list for destinations for a specific vehicle

//The destination should be a mapobject? i think so or part of a map object? hmmmmm
//Perhaps part of a mapobject
//It should be driveway ??




//CIRLCE BUG.  Need to eliminate these

//implement a timer for getting the vehicle moving when its blocked

//Bounds bug that will error out when sending a vehicle to teh edge of the map
//Bug with certain parts of land next to water not being accessible

//Minimap options.  Toggle different things

//Show labels only
//Show firetrucks only
//Show labels and firetrucks


//Make information pop ups
//For Vehicles
//And for intersections
//Make it so you can click an intersection and manually control its lighting times
//Also make it manually control its lighting times itself
//But the intersection will also show a counter of vehicles
//Heading north, east, west, south etc


//Getting some blocking things happening still
//3 way intersections.  can get this big overlap of 4 vehicles.  We remove the tail reference on a tile, but somehow something can go wierd and stack
//Not sure if it happens on 4 ways now


//We could draw trees etc in different shades to add some element of difference to them
//just slightly different shade offsets


//Add control group pictures for each control group in bottom middle of screen
//Make them have rounded edge background
//Make them have control group number and number of how many vehicles are in the group
//Modify those stupid cirlces on the right
