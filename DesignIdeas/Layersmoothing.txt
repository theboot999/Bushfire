Logic. Start with highest number first
Anything higher than it needs to be smoothed
So any neighbours higher than you,  add the adjacent side or corner in your smoothing tile for that



Start with 3.  No neighbours higher

Go to 2.. has 2 neighbours of 3 highers
Go to 1..  has 3 neighours of 3 highers


We could also potentaly make it so
if you got 2 diagonals next to each other, run a diagonal smooth.  However this will make the tile be 50% water and yet still passable
