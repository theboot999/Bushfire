Reorganise classes

WorldController Class?  Create world in there?

When creating a new game screen we pass the world in there.  The worldcontroller class stores the world.  So when we create a new gameview we get the world from the world controller class? or do we pass the world in.  Having a world controller is good in the sense we can interact with it from anywhere

Add serialiasble and try save the world

Add view culling for drawing using our new way. dont draw everything.

Add on the fly calculations for the rectangle output when drawing.  that way we can just store tile x and y coordinates as int.  Do some benchmarks on how much slower it is



Change Layercontroller to tile controller? maybe not because its only controlling layers
