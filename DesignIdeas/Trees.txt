Before we do road geneartion

add a groundtype called trees

i think we use another astar map to make trees

so when we do road generation the trees have a little more score for pathfinding for the road.

so if theres a big forest you might do the road aroudn it

Lets also practise running another thread in the update function
and have this thread start at update. 
and the main thread doesnt move to draw until the toehr thread is ready
simply use a bool
