modfiy the get layer tile. well at least for shadows

top left is normal

top right if flipped vertically

bottom left is flipped horizantly

top left is rotated 180 degrees

spritesheet has 3 extra tiles. shadows

in teh building designer we select what are the left shadow tiles.  adn we select what are the right shadow tiles




So what does our picker need
Building Type
Size.  We have a 10 x 10 grid, however we need to be able to change the grid.
If needs be good to shrink the grid from the left and the right etc etc
Simple X, Y, Width and Height box?

We need to have a shadow picker.  Basically show the left shadow tiles and the right shadow tiles in different colours

we need things like.. 
toggle grid.
toggle shadow colours

draw example (Draws with the top tile sheet)
building style height.  This affects the shadows? or should building style height be on the sprite sheet hegiht



then the output grid is basically based on that

Everything will always be face dwon.  driveway down


we need the different types
Roof
parking
Road

So in the final building output. we have the driveway down
in the building class, we need to have the facing direction, because when we are trying to place it it needs to know that
