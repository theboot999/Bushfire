Idea
Town names

Just save them to a file probably and read them

then

we can have a town list?

This is basically the town point sites list.  we keep that list with a town point in it

because then


we can itterate through that list. the first point on that list that is in our screen bounds will be out town displayed at the top
we can also write the town names on our mini map in white
however they probably shouldnt be baked into the texture. but instead drawn in, and they can be drawn using the ui scale

so the towns will have a point of world position, and also a vector of minimap position.

so drawing in the minimap class we can write the vector text
